📊 Predictive Analysis Using Regression Models

🔍 This project utilizes pre-implemented machine learning algorithms in Python to predict an important feature from a processed and cleaned dataset. The following regression models are applied:

✅ Linear Regression
✅ Decision Tree Regression
✅ Random Forest Regression

📈 Below, we visualize the accuracy of predictions compared to actual values from the database.

📊 Algorithms Used
The following regression algorithms are implemented and compared:

🔹 Linear Regression
A simple regression model that assumes a linear relationship between input and output variables.

🔹 Decision Tree Regression
A non-linear model that splits the data into decision-based branches for predictions.

🔹 Random Forest Regression
An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions for higher accuracy.

📌 Each model's performance is evaluated and compared visually and numerically.

⚙️ Data Processing
The dataset used in this project has undergone multiple preprocessing and cleaning steps, including:

🔹 Removing null or missing values 🗑️
🔹 Normalizing/standardizing numerical features 📏
🔹 Encoding categorical variables 🔡
🔹 Handling outliers and inconsistencies 📊

✅ These steps ensure data quality and improve model accuracy.

📏 Model Evaluation
The models are assessed using the following key performance metrics:

📌 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.
📌 Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Penalizes larger errors by squaring them.
📌 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) – Square root of MSE, making it more interpretable.
📌 R-squared (R²) – Indicates how well the model explains variance in the data.

📊 These metrics help us understand how accurate and reliable each model is.
